    <p><h4>Dataset</h4>
    <br/>
    You can find the original data file through <a href='Kaggle.com'>Kaggle.com</a>. Here is the link to the exact dataset <a href=https://www.kaggle.com/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents>US Accidents (4.2 million records)</a>. 
    In order to use Kaggle, you do need to create a free account. Due to the size of the original dataset, we were unable to load it to the repository so if you choose to run the notebook code to 'clean' and narrow down the dataset (cleaning_csv.ipynb), you will first need to download it from Kaggle.
