# What is the best environment in San Antonio to reduce the chances of getting in an accident?

#### Summary

For this project we came across a dataset that included car accidents from 2016 to Dec 2020 in all fifty states. Due to the size of the dataset csv and time constraints of our presentation, we decided to only study accident patterns in Texas, specifically in San Antonio. Our analysis answers the following questions, 
1) Which city has the lowest and highest amount of accidents? 
2) What is the best weather condition to drive in San Antonio? 
3) What time of day do more accidents occur in San Antonio?
